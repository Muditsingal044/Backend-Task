# **Product Transactions API**

> A lightweight and efficient RESTful API designed to manage and analyze product transactions.

This project **fetches product data** from a third-party API and stores it in a structured database. It offers several endpoints to handle key operations, including listing transactions with **search and pagination**, generating **sales statistics** for a selected month, and creating **bar and pie chart data** for visualization. Additionally, it combines analytics into a single endpoint for comprehensive insights. Built using **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **SQLite**, the API is simple to set up, scalable, and ideal for analyzing sales data effectively.
